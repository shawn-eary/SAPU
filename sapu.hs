-- This is a password manager and it is in the alpha stage.  You are
-- welcome to browse the code to see very basic Haskell but do not
-- use this Password Manager.  I am *NOT* a security expert and this
-- password manager was slapped together in a big hurry.  It is more
-- of an academic exercise than anything else.  I accept *NO*
-- repsonsibility for anything bad this might program might do to your
-- passwords, identity, mental stability or anything else.  With that
-- said, you are certainly welcome to write your own password manager
-- but again if it blows up and half the world dies off, that's not
-- my problem...

-- This program uses the following Haskell Packages clipboard, split,
-- haskeline and cryptonite.  You will need to install them before
-- compiling this one file program.
--
-- APPROXIMATE COMPILATION STEPS for MS Windows:
-- cabal install clipboard
-- cabal install haskeline
-- NOT Used Right now - Want to use in future-- cabal install cryptonite
-- cabal install SimpleAES
-- cabal install split
-- ghc passMgr.hs

-- REFERNCE APPOLOGY:
-- While I would like for this to be an academic work, it is not
-- one.  This code is written in haste because I have a day job.
-- If I've accidently missed someone that has signifiantly helped
-- me without citing then or a "parent"/similar source, I appologize.
-- I will try to correct the situation when I become aware.  Also,
-- things that are common knowlege are not required to be cited, but
-- with me being a paranoid person, I tend to cite whenever I get
-- help
